# 💻 42 C++ Modules 00–04

This repository contains my solutions for the **C++ Modules 00–04** from the 42 programming curriculum. These modules gradually introduce C++ concepts such as classes, memory management, operator overloading, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract interfaces.

Each module is a step deeper into C++ best practices and object-oriented design.

## 📦 Module Overview

### 🧱 Module 00 – Basics of C++

- Differences between C and C++
- `std::string`, `iostream`, and stream insertion/extraction
- Basic class definition and usage
- Member functions, constructors, and destructors
- Namespaces and compilation basics

✅ **What I Learned**: Object-oriented syntax, class vs struct, and method encapsulation.

---

### 🔄 Module 01 – Memory and References

- Stack vs Heap allocation
- `new` and `delete`
- Reference and pointer behavior
- Scope, lifetime, and object management
- File I/O using `ifstream` / `ofstream`

✅ **What I Learned**: Manual memory management, pointer safety, and object lifetimes.

---

### ⚙️ Module 02 – Ad-Hoc Polymorphism

- Operator overloading
- Overloading functions and methods
- Using `const`, `this`, and private/public access
- Using initializer lists in constructors

✅ **What I Learned**: Cleaner interfaces, operator design, and class customization.

---

### 🏗️ Module 03 – Inheritance and Polymorphism

- Inheritance and access specifiers (`public`, `protected`)
- Method overriding
- Virtual methods and dynamic dispatch
- Using base class pointers

✅ **What I Learned**: Dynamic behavior with base references, and writing reusable code via polymorphism.

---

### 🧩 Module 04 – Abstract Classes and Interfaces

- Pure virtual methods
- Abstract classes
- Interface design in C++
- Polymorphic behavior using abstract base classes
- Dynamic memory with polymorphism

✅ **What I Learned**: Designing extensible systems with interface-based architecture and abstract classes.

## 🛠 Compilation

Each module comes with its own `Makefile`. Simply navigate to the desired module folder and run:

```bash
make
./programName
```
